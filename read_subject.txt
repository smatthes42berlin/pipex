- open infile
- run cmd1 with infile as input
- send output to cmd 2
- run output with cmd 2
- write output of cmd 2 to file


- execve -> path to exe, argarr, envarr
- search through all path to look for executable?
- check every path in the path variable to find program
- error handling with error codes in errno

- check how non existing files are handled
- check, that you have access to commands and commands exist


- before doing anything, check if files are openable, permissions, command with access

- check that it hangs with /dev/urandom (see slack)
- Special edge cases: /dev/urandom and /dev/stdin
